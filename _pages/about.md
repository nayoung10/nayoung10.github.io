I am currently a researcher at [MLLab @ POSTECH](https://ml.postech.ac.kr/), advised by [Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home). Beginning February 2025, I will start my Ph.D. at KAIST under his supervision. I work on deep learning for drug and material discovery. 

Previously, I completed an M.S. at the Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI at KAIST, where I was advised by [Jinkyoo Park](http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/). I also hold a B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at KAIST.
