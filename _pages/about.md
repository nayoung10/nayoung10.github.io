I am a Ph.D. student at the Graduate School of AI @ KAIST, advised by [Sungsoo Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/sungsooahn0215/home). I am interested in generative models for materials and biomolecules. 

Previously, I completed an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at KAIST, advised by [Jinkyoo Park](http://silab.kaist.ac.kr/). I also hold a B.S. in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from KAIST.
