Materials span a wide range of structural and chemical complexities, from amorphous polymers to highly ordered solids. Among them, **crystals** refer to materials with a *regular*, *repeating* arrangement of atoms or molecules. Many everyday materials are crystalline (Figure 1): *diamond*, known for its extreme hardness; *quartz*, used in electronics; and *table salt*, essential in daily life. Designing new crystalline materials with desirable properties is at the heart of breakthroughs in energy, electronics, and environmental sustainability.

In recent years, **generative models** have gained attention as powerful tools for automating the design of novel crystal structures. Most existing work focuses on **inorganic crystals**<d-cite key="jiao2024crystal"></d-cite><d-cite key="millerflowmm"></d-cite><d-cite key="linequivariant"></d-cite>, which include materials like semiconductors, superconductors, and catalysts. More recently, some attention has turned to **metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)**<d-cite key="fu2023mofdiff"></d-cite>, a crystalline materials composed of **metal clusters** and **organic linkers**. Their porous structures and high tunability make them promising candidates for gas storage<d-cite key="li2018recent"></d-cite><d-cite key="qian2020mof"></d-cite>, catalysis,<d-cite key="lee2009metal"></d-cite> and drug delivery<d-cite key="horcajada2012metal"></d-cite>. 

### Two Types of Crystals, Two Types of Challenges

While both inorganic crystals and MOFs are crystalline materials, their fundamental differences introduce distinct challenges for generative modeling:
- **Inorganic crystals** typically contain fewer atoms per structure and exhibit high degrees of **symmetry**. However, they lack natural subunits, making them difficult to decompose or simplify for modeling.
- **MOFs**, in contrast, often consist of hundreds to thousands of atoms per structure. Fortunately, their **modular nature** allows them to be decomposed into well-defined building blocks: metal nodes and organic linkers.


|                   |     **Inorganic**       |       **MOF**        |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Size    | ~10-50 atoms/structure | ~50-2000 atoms/structure|
| Key structural trait | Symmetry-rich | Modular |
| Generation challenge | Capturing symmetry | Scaling to large structures | 


In this blogpost, we explore two recent generative models that address these distinct challenges:
- **SymmCD (ICLR 2025)**<d-cite key="levy2025symmcd"></d-cite> targets *inorganic crystals* using a diffusion model that explicitly incorporates *symmetry*. By learning to generate only the *asymmetric unit* and expanding it via symmetry operations, it ensures validity and efficiency in generation.
- **MOFDiff (ICLR 2024)**<d-cite key="fu2023mofdiff"></d-cite> focuses on *MOFs* by leveraging their modularity through a *coarse-grained representation*. By learning to generate the coarse-grained representation, MOFDiff succesffully generates large and complex MOF structures. 

The following table provides a quick **summary** of the two works:

## SymmCD: Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Generation with Diffusion Models

### Preliminary: Representing Crystals

{% include figure.html 
path="assets/img/2025-04-28-_nayoung/unit_cell.png" 
class="img-fluid" 
caption="Figure 2. The unit cell representation of a crystal. The ideal, infinite crystal structure can be recovered by replicating the cell along the three lattice vectors."
%}

To represent a 3D structure of a **molecule** with $$N$$ atoms, we typically specify two components: 
1. The atom types $$\bA=(a_1, \dots, a_N) \in \cA^N$$, where each $$\cA$$ is the set of possible elements,  
2. The 3D coordinates of those atoms,  $$\bX=(x_1, \dots, x_N) \in \bbR^{N \times 3}$$. 

**Crystals** are similar, but with one key addition: the **lattice**. The lattice is defined by three lattice vectors $$\mathbf{L}=(l_1, l_2, l_3) \in \bbR^{N \times 3}$$ which describe how the unit cell repeasts in space. This compact **unit cell representation** $$\cM = (\bA, \bX, \bL)$$ contains all the information needed to define a crystal. By translating the atoms along the lattice vectors $$l_1, l_2, l_3$$, we can reconstruct the full (theorectically infinite) periodic structure of the crystal (Figure 2). 

### Asymmetric Unit and Site Symmetries

{% include figure.html 
path="assets/img/2025-04-28-_nayoung/asymmetric_unit.png" 
class="img-fluid" 
caption="Figure 3. (left) An asymmetric unit can be unfolded using symmetry operations to reconstruct the full unit cell. (right) SymmCD generates the asymmetric unit, which contains the atom types, coordinates, lattice, and site symmetries."
%}

While the unit cell representation $$\cM = (\bA, \bX, \bL)$$ compactly represents a crystal, **SymmCD** uses an even smaller representation: the **asymmetric unit**. The asymmetric unit can be combined with crystal symmetry operations to reconstruct the full unit cell (Figure 3, *left*).

A useful analogy for understanding the asymmetric unit is *cutting a paper snowflake*<d-cite key="fredericks2021pyxtal"></d-cite>: the folded paper represents the asymmetrc unit, and unfolding aplies the symmetry to create the full pattern of the paper snowflake. 

But hereâ€™s the subtle part: *where* you make the cut affects how many times it appears in the final pattern. For instance, a cut at the center of the folded paper is repeated six times, while a cut at an edge appears three times. In crystallography, this concept is captured by the **site symmetry** -- it tells you *how* to replicate an atom based on its position on the asymmetric unit. 

SymmCD leverages these two simple concepts for inorganic crystal generation. Rather than generating the full crystal, it generates just the asymmetric unit, which contains the atom types, coordinates, lattice, and site symmetries (Figure 3, *right*). This simplifies the generation process while guaranteeing that the resulting structures are symmetric.

Mathematically, we represent an asymmetric unit with:
- Atom types $$\bA' = (a_1, \dots, a_M) \in \cA^M$$, 
- 3D coordinates $$\bX=(x_1, \dots, x_M) \in \bbR^{M \times 3}$$, 
- Asymmetric lattice $$\mathbf{k} \in \mathbb{R}^6$$ (see the paper<d-cite key="levy2025symmcd"></d-cite> for details), and 
- Site symmetries $$\bS = (S_{x_1'}, \dots, S_{x_M'}) \in \mathcal{P}^M$$, where $$\mathcal{P}$$ denotes the set of all possible site symmetries. 

Note that $$M \leq N$$, since the asymmetric unit contains only a subset of the atoms in the full unit cell.

### SymmCD: Pre-processing, Training, and Sampling

{% include figure.html

%}

#### Pre-processing: Extracting the Asymmetric Unit

Before we can train a model to generate crystals, we first need to define what it should generate. Rather than modeling the full crystal, SymmCD focuses on its minimal building block: the **asymmetric unit**. But *how* do we find that?

It turns out that all crystalsâ€”yes, all of themâ€”fall into just 230 possible space groups, each encoding a unique combination of symmetry operations. Given a crystal in unit cell form, $$\cM = (\bA, \bX, \bL)$$, we first identify its space group $$G$$ (there are python packages built for this purpose -- e.g., spglib). This space group tells us how the crystal repeats and, in turn, defines its asymmetric unit.

$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D} = \{ (\bA, \bX, \bL)  \} \Rightarrow{} \mathcal{D} = \{ (G, k, \bA', \bX', \bS)  \}.
\end{equation}
$$

#### Training the Model

SymmCD models the joint distribution as:
$$
\begin{equation}
p_{\theta}(G, k, \bA', \bX', \bS)=p_{\theta}( k, \bA', \bX', \bS \vert G)p(G).
\end{equation}
$$

In other words, once a space group $$G$$ is specified (or sampled), the model learns to generate the corresponding asymmetric unit. To do this, SymmCD uses a diffusion model, where the atom types and site symmetries $$\bA', \bS$$ are learned with discrete diffusion and the lattice $$k, \bX'$$ are learned with continuous diffusion. 

#### Sampling and Post-processing

Generating inorganic crystal structures with SymmCD is straightforward: (1) Choose a space group $$G$$ -- either randomly or specifying, (2) Sample $$(k, \bA', \bX', \bS) \sim p_{\theta}( k, \bA', \bX', \bS \vert G)$$ with the trained diffusion model, and (3) Project atoms into valid **Wyckoff positions** based on their site symmetries. 

Why is this projection needed? Recall the paper snowflake analogy: cuts made at different parts of the folded paper produce different numbers of copies. Similarly, certain regions of the asymmetric unit only permit specific site symmetries. If a generated atom-site symmetry pair is incompatible, we adjust (i.e., project) the atomâ€™s position to a compatible one.

Finally, we replicate the asymmetric unit using its site symmetries to reconstruct the full crystal $$\cM = (\bA, \bX, \bL)$$. By shifting the focus from full crystals to asymmetric unit, SymmCD enjoys higher computational efficiency. 

### Experimental results: what advantages does SymmCD have?

{% include figure.html 
path="assets/img/2025-04-28-_nayoung/symmcd_results.png" 
class="img-fluid" 
caption="Results."
%}

In the experiments, we randomly generate 10,000 crystals in each baseline and identify the proportion of space group symmetries. The experiments show that both SymmCD and DiffCSP++<d-cite key="jiaospace"></d-cite> generates samples with *diverse* space group symmetries. Yet, SymmCD is able to generate more *novel* structures that are not in the training dataset. This is because DiffCSP++ starts with a template extracted from the training dataset and refine it with their model. 

## MOFDiff: Coarse-grained Diffusion for Metal-Organic Framework Design

### Preliminary: Coarse-grained representation for MOFs 

{% include figure.html 
path="assets/img/2025-04-28-_nayoung/mof_representation.png" 
class="img-fluid" 
caption="Results."
%}

Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are some of the most structurally complex materials known. Compared to inorganic crystals, theyâ€™re much larger, often containing hundreds to thousands of atoms per unit cell. This scale makes direct generation at the atomic level both inefficient and error-prone for traditional generative models.

Fortunately, MOFs come with a built-in advantage: modularity. Each MOF is composed of repeating building blocksâ€”metal clusters and organic linkersâ€”that connect in well-defined ways. This modularity lets us step back and see MOFs not as clouds of atoms, but as assemblies of interacting components.

Instead of representing MOFs as full atomic structures $$(\bA, \bX, \bL)$$, MOFDiff uses a simplified, coarse-grained representation
$$
\begin{equation}
  \cM^C = (\bA^C, \bX^C, \bL)
\end{equation}
$$
where:
- $$\bA^C = (a_1^C, \dots, a_K^C) \in \mathbb{B}^{K}$$ are the building block types (e.g., a specific metal node or linker),
- $$\bX^C = (x_1^C, \dots x_k^C) \in \bbR^{K \times 3}$$ are their 3D Cartesian coordinates, and
- $$\bL$$ is the lattice that defines periodicity (same). 

Because the number of building blocks $$K$$ is often orders of magnitude smaller than the number of atoms $$N$$ (i.e., $$K \ll N$$), this representation is much more efficient to model. 

And thatâ€™s the core idea behind MOFDiffâ€”instead of modeling the full atomic structure, it learns a score-based diffusion model over a simplified, coarse-grained representation of MOFs.

### Learning building block representations

{% include figure.html 
path="assets/img/2025-04-28-_nayoung/contrastive_learning.png" 
class="img-fluid" 
caption="Results."
%}

But how do we represent these building blocks effectively?

A naive approach might be to extract all building blocks from the training dataset, assign each a one-hot ID, and then train a diffusion model: discrete diffusion for the building block types $$\bA^c$$, and continuous diffusions for their positions $$\bX^C$$ and lattice $$\bL$$. 

However, this naive strategy quickly falls apart. The training dataset contains millions of building blocksâ€”around 2 million extracted from 289k MOFsâ€”which makes one-hot encoding extremely sparse and hard to learn. Even worse, many of these building blocks are topologically identicalâ€”they have the same atom and bond structure (i.e., same 2D graph), differing only slightly in 3D geometry, making this representation very inefficient. 

To overcome this, MOFDiff learns a **dense**, **continuous** embedding $$\bA^C$$ for each building block that captures topological similarity while remaining efficient to model. It does this by training a **SE(3)-invariant graph neural network** takes as input the $$i$$ building block (i.e., its atom types and coordinates) and outputs a dense embedding $$\mathbf{b}_i \in \bbR^d$$ corresponding to that building block. 

To ensure that the learned embeddings group similar building blocks together, MOFDiff uses a **contrastive learning objective**. It first computes 2D fingerprints (ECFP4) to define molecular similarity, and then trains the model to bring structurally similar blocks close in embedding space.

The contrastive loss is defined as:

$$
\begin{equation}
   \mathcal{L}_C = - \log \sum_{i \in \mathbf{B}} \frac{\sum_{j \in \mathbf{B}_i^{+}} \exp(s_{i,j} / \tau)}{\frac{\sum_{j \in \mathbf{B}_i^{+}} \exp(s_{i,j} / \tau)}
\end{equation}
$$
where  
- $\mathbf{B}$ is a batch of building blocks,  
- $\mathbf{B}_i^{+} \subseteq \mathbf{B}$ are building blocks with the same ECFP4 fingerprint as $i$,  
- $s_{i,j}$ is the *cosine similarity* between projected building block embeddings:  
$$
\begin{equation}
   s_{i,j} = \frac{\mathbf{p}_i^{\top} \mathbf{p}_j}{\|\mathbf{p}_i\| \|\mathbf{p}_j\|}, \quad \mathbf{p}_i = \operatorname{MLP}(\mathbf{b}_i)
\end{equation}
$$
- $\tau$ is the temperature.

Once trained, this encoder maps each building block to a dense embedding. All MOFs in the dataset can then be transformed into their coarse-grained representation $$\cM = (\bA, \bX, \bL)$$, where $$\bA^C = (\mathbf{b}_1, \dots, \mathbf{b}_K) \in \bbR^{K \times d}$$ with $$d=32$$ -- a far more compact representation than a one-hot encoding over ~2M types of building blocks. 

### Training MOFDiff

{% include figure.html 
path="assets/img/2025-04-28-_nayoung/mofdiff_training.png" 
class="img-fluid" 
caption="Results."
%}

With the coarse-grained representation in place, itâ€™s time to train the generative model.

MOFDiff aims to model the full joint distribution over the coarse-grained structure and an auxiliary latent variable $$\mathbf{z}$$:
$$
\begin{equation}
  p_{\theta}(\bA^C, \bX^C, \bL, K, z) = p_{\theta}(L, K \vert \mathbf{z}) p_{\theta}(\bA^c, \bX^C \vert L, k, \mathbf{z}),
\end{equation}
$$
where:
- $$\bA^C=(\mathbf{b}_1, \dots, \mathbf{b}_K) \in \bbR^{K \times d}$$ and $$\bX^C = (x_1^C, \dots x_k^C) \in \bbR^{K \times 3}$$ are the building block types and positions with $$K$$ as the number of building blocks, 
- $$\bL$$ is the lattice,
- $$\mathbf{z}$$ is a latent vector used for generating the $$\bL$$, $$K$$.

This distribution is factorized as:
$$
\begin{equation}
  p_{\theta}(\bA^C, \bX^C, \bL, K, z) = p_{\theta}(L, K \vert \mathbf{z}) p_{\theta}(\bA^c, \bX^C \vert L, K, \mathbf{z}). 
\end{equation}
$$
Here, the first part, $$p_{\theta}(L, K \vert \mathbf{z})$$ is modeled using an MLP:
$$
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\bL}, \hat{K} = \operatorname{MLP}_{\bL, K}(\mathbf{z}),
\end{equation}
$$
while the second part, $$p_{\theta}(\bA^c, \bX^C \vert L, k, \mathbf{z})$$ is modeled using score-based diffusion, where a periodic graph neural network denoiser $$\operatorname{PGNN}_D$$ predicts the noise in the atom types and coordinates as:
$$
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{s}_{\bA^C}, \mathbf{s}_{\bX^C} = \operatorname{PGNN}_D(\tilde{\cM}_t^C, z),
\end{equation}
$$
where $$\tilde{\cM}_t^C=(\bA_t^C, \bX_t^C, \bL)$$ is the noised version of the coarse-grained structure at timestep $$t$$, and $$\mathbf{z}$$ is the latent vector produced with a periodict graph neural network encoder $$\operatorname{PGNN}_E$$: 
$$
\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{z} = \operatorname{PGNN}_E(\cM^C).
\end{equation}

where $$p_{\theta}(L, K \vert \mathbf{z})$$ simply learned as a degenerate distribution with $$\hat{\bL}, \hat{K} = \operatorname{MLP_{\bL, K}(mathbf{z})$$ and $$p_{\theta}(\bA^c, \bX^C \vert L, k, \mathbf{z})$$ is learned with a denoiser for score-based diffusion as: $$\mathbf{s}_{\bA^C}, \mathbf{s}_{\bX^C} = \operatorname{PGNN}_D(\tilde{\cM}_t^C, z)$$, where $$\operatorname{PGNN}_D$$ is a periodic graph-neural network (we omit $$K$$ since it is implictly included as the dimension). The additional latent representation $$\mathbf{z}$$ is learned with an encoder as $$\mathbf{z} = \operatorname{PGNN}_E(\cM^C)$$, where $$\operatorname{PGNN}_E$$ is a periodic graph neural network encoder as well. 

#### Objective function
The denoiser $$\operatorname{PGNN}_D(\cM_t^C, z)$$ is trained using the standard denoising score objective:
$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\boldsymbol{A}}=\mathbb{E}_{t, \boldsymbol{M}^C, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\boldsymbol{A}}}\left[\left\|\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\boldsymbol{A}}-\boldsymbol{s}_{\boldsymbol{A}_t^C, \boldsymbol{z}}\right\|^2\right], \quad
\mathcal{L}_{\boldsymbol{X}}=\mathbb{E}_{t, \boldsymbol{M}^C, \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\boldsymbol{X}}}\left[\sigma_t^2\left\|\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_{\boldsymbol{X}}-\boldsymbol{s}_{\boldsymbol{X}_t^C, \boldsymbol{z}}\right\|^2\right].
\end{equation}
$$
$$\operatorname{MLP}_{\bL, K}(\mathbf{z})$$ is supervised with the mean squared error and cross-entropy losses:
$$
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{\boldsymbol{L}, K}=\|\boldsymbol{L}-\hat{\boldsymbol{L}}\|^2+\operatorname{CrossEntropy}(K, \hat{K}).
\end{equation}
$$
Finally, the encoder $$\operatorname{PGNN}_E$$ is regularized with a KL divergence $$\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KL}}$$ to match a standard normal prior. 

The overall training objective for MOFDiff combines all components as:
$$
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text {MOFDiff }}=\mathcal{L}_{\boldsymbol{A}}+\mathcal{L}_{\boldsymbol{X}}+\mathcal{L}_{\boldsymbol{L}, K}+\beta_{\mathrm{KL}} \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{KL}}.
\end{equation}
$$
where $$\beta_{\mathrm{KL}}$$ is a hyperparameter that controls the strength of KL regularization, set to 0.01. 

### Sampling pipeline for MOFDiff

{% include figure.html 
path="assets/img/2025-04-28-_nayoung/self_assembly.png" 
class="img-fluid" 
caption="Results."
%}

Once MOFDiff is trained, we can generate a new MOF structure with the following process:
1. **Sample** a random latent code $$\mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,I)$$.
2. **Predict** the lattice and number of building blocks:
$$
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\bL}, \hat{K} = \operatorname{MLP}_{\bL, K}(mathbf{z})
\end{equation}
$$
3. **Run denoising diffusion** with the trained denoiser $$\operatorname{PGNN}_D(\tilde{\cM}_t^C, z)$$ to generate the coarse-grained structure $$(\bA^C, \bX^C, \bL)$$. 

At this point, we have a **coarse-grained MOF**. We now need to recover the full atomic structure with fine-graned details. Here's how:
1. **Building block decoding**. For each generated embedding $$\bA^C$$, we retrieve the building block from the training dataset with the closest embedding with nearest neighbor search. This gives us the actual atom types and coordinates of the building block. 
2. **Self-assembly (orientation prediction)**. Since we have only predicted the center of mass of each building block with $$\bX^C$$, we now need to know *how to orient them*. MOFDiff uses an optimization-based **sef-assembly algorithm** to find the rotation that maximizes the alignment of 
connection points between the building blocks. This maximizes the connectivity and minimizes the gaps between the metal nodes and organic linkers. 
3. **Force field relaxation**. Finally, the assembled structure undergoes relaxation with energy minimziation with the UFF force field. This step ensures that we can make a final fine-grained refinement to get a physical structure. 

### Evaluation results

#### Generating valid, novel, and unique MOFs

How does MOFDiff perform in practice? To evaluate it, the authors sampled 10,000 MOF structures and assessed them on three key metrics: **validity**, **novelty**, and **uniqueness**.
- **Validity**: A structure is considered valid if it passes the check with a python package called `MOFchecker`, which assess whether a MOF is chemically and physicall valid based on a set of criteria including the presence of at least one metal, carbon, and hydrogen atom, overlapping atoms, and valency.  
- **Novelty**: A structure is novel if it nodes not exist in the training dataset. This is measured with `MOFid`, which computes a unique identifier for a MOF baesd on its building blocks and connectivity.Make 
- **Uniqueness**: We find the unique structures by filtering out the duplicates from the generated set of structures.

Out of 10,000 generated structures, **3,012 passed the validity check** and **2,998** were **valid**, **novely**, and **unique**. That's nearly 3,000 high-quality MOFs generated from scratch -- an impressive result given the structural complexity and the size of MOFs. 

#### Discovering high-performing MOFs for carbon capture

Thanks to the latent variable $$\mathbf{z}$$, MOFDiff can also be used for property-guided generation.

Suppose you want to discover MOFs with high CO$_{2}$ working capacity -- a key metric for carbon capture technology. MOFDiff enables this by learning a simple property predictor during training:
$$
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\mathbf{c}} = \operatorname{MLP}_P(\mathbf{z}),
\end{equation}
$$
where $$\mathbf{c}$$ is the property of interest (e.g., CO$_{2}$ capacity). The predictor is trained with the mean squared error loss using known property labels. 

Then, during sampling, MOFDiff generates many latent codes $$\mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$$, computes the CO$_{2}$ working capacity $$\hat{\mathbf{c}}$$, and filters for those with high CO@ working capacity. 

In experiments, this approach successfully generates MOFs with higher CO$_{2}$ working capcity than those in the training dataset, demonstrating MOFDiff's potential for targeted material discovery.
